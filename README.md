Referenced Tutorials Point, Data to Fish, Geeks for Geeks, Project Python, FavTutor (Shivali Bhadaniya), and had help from instructor. I don't think any code was directly borrowed. Most of these sources provided
information on how to use various functions and techniques. I wasn't completely successful in exporting all the required text for the text files. In PyPoll, I was trying to use a for loop to write multiple lines 
to the file, but that didn't work. I didn't see any other way that would have been adaptable to other data sets, so that text file is incomplete. The problem came up very late and I didn't have a chance to in
inquire about it. Everything else should be fine.
